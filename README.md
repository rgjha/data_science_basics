# Data_Science_Basics

Personal collection of notebooks and study material for exploring the field of data science and machine learning. Mostly classical! 


# Logs

15 February 2023: Created repository and added past notebooks/resources  <br />
26 February 2023: Check pipeline scheme with Lasso implementation  <br />
27 February 2023: Do the basic PyTorch setup and do some regression <br />
28 February 2023: Neural network classification (not only binary), start Computer Vision  <br />
01 March 2023: Try Baseline neural network with non-linear layers <br />
02 March 2023: Brushed NLP, Kaggle resources, and Recommender Systems <br />
05 March 2023: Practice problems on HackerRank. Add some solutions to the notes <br />
06 March 2023: Movie Recommender Systems using KNN <br />
07 March 2023: Tweet Analysis (NLP) for natural calamity - Kaggle <br /> 
08 March 2023: Do bit of MySQL, and submit first attempt to Kaggle. <br />
09 March 2023: Play around with my own flight data since 2009. Start working on House Price Regression  <br />
10 March 2023: Work on book recommendation task based on dot product and neural network methods. <br />
11/12 March 2023: Scrap data from IMDB and do regression. Try how to fix absent ratings in matrix using ALS <br /> 
13 March 2023: Check CNN and GNN. Much more left to do. Go back to Kaggle tomorrow <br />
14 March 2023: Try using neural networks for stock prices and for CIFAR image set. <br />
16 March 2023: Read about BERT and Transformers. Should get more NLP reading before going there <br />
18 March 2023: Revise statistics, probability. Check spaCy and revise tensorflow. <br />
22 March 2023: In the last 4 days, submitted a notebook to Kaggle on NLP. Fixed bug in flight code. Played around with
arXiv data. Read about LeNet 5-layer, LSTM. Did EDA on a Media consumption data (Deloitte).
